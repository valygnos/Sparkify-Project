# Sparkify-Project

As part of the Udacity Data Science program, students are required to complete a capstone project using Spark, a popular big data processing framework. One such project involves predicting churn for Sparkify, a simulated music streaming service that closely emulates real-world streaming services like Spotify.

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately identify users who are likely to cancel their subscription to Sparkify, based on their interactions with the platform. This involves analyzing a large dataset of user activity logs, which includes information such as the songs played, the length of each session, and the type of device used.
